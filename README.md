# 1 Fruit Freshness Detection Model

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to detect the freshness of fruits based on image data. The model is built using a hybrid architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing any temporal patterns.

## Libraries Used
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: 
  - Used for building deep learning models.
  - Key components: `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `LSTM`, `Dense`, etc.
- **scikit-learn**:
  - Used for evaluating the model and dataset splitting.
  - Key components: `classification_report`, `confusion_matrix`, `train_test_split`.
- **NumPy**:
  - Used for array manipulation and numerical operations.
- **OS & Shutil**:
  - Used for file and directory operations to organize the dataset.
- **ZipFile**:
  - Used to extract the dataset from a zip archive.

## Functions

### 1. Dataset Splitting (`split_data`)
This function is used to split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

#### Parameters:
- `SOURCE`: Path to the source directory containing the images.
- `TRAINING`, `VALIDATION`, `TESTING`: Paths to destination directories for the respective splits.
- `train_size`, `val_size`, `test_size`: Ratios for splitting the dataset.

### 2. Model Training & Evaluation
- **Layers like `Conv2D` and `LSTM`**: Used to define the model that extracts image features and processes temporal patterns.
- **Evaluation**:
  - The model is evaluated using `classification_report` and `confusion_matrix` to assess accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.
## How to Run
1. Unzip the dataset using the `ZipFile` library.
2. Use the `split_data` function to split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
3. Define the model architecture using TensorFlow's Keras API.
4. Train the model and evaluate its performance using the provided metrics.
